# FLIGHTMATE

General rules for contributing to this project (Yes, it's annoying, but it will protect us from overwriting peoples' work and protect our main project).

1. You must create a Pull Request (also known as a PR). Naming conventions usually work as <initials>/<feature-name>. So if I'm making a feature, it might look like gm/feedback-form.
2. Code must be approved by one other team member. It keeps everyone accountable, and makes sure we push quality code.

## To start working on this code

You're going to have to create a token for authentication. You can retrieve this from Github: [https://github.com/settings/tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
- Select `Personal Access Tokens (Classic)`, then click `Generate New Token`
- Set an expiry date if you want, or never. Up to you. Select the options below only.

You will then obtain a code. This is you "password" for Eclipse. Paste your github email address in the "User" section, and your token in the "password" section.

Click "next", until you finish. This will import the project.
